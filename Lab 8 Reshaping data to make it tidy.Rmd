#This was limited to these countries for the sake of clarity in the graph
```{r}

*Post your graph from Exercise 8 to the #lab8 channel.Answer the following via DM to me: If you got stuck somewhere along the way doing this lab, where was it? What did you do to get unstuck? If you didnâ€™t get stuck, what part of this process did you find the most difficult?*

Yes I got stuck transforming the years from a string of characters to a string of numbers; this lead to confusing errors when I tried to graph my pot. It seemed like every country got their own time series graph.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)
Lab_8 <- read_csv("~/Git Folder/HW 4/Lab 8.csv")
#View(Lab_8)

Lab_8<- Lab_8 %>% rename(country = `Estimated HIV Prevalence% - (Ages 15-49)`)

newdata <- Lab_8 %>% gather( key = "Year", value = "Cases", -country)
head(newdata)
#dim(newdata)

newdata<- newdata %>% mutate(Year1 = parse_number(Year))

hiv_plot <- newdata %>% ggplot(aes(x = Year1, y = Cases, color= country))+geom_point()####I am still having trouble displaying this###

hiv_plot
```
